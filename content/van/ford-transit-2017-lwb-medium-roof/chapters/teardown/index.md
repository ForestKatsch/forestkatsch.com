So.
I bought a van.

It's a 2017 Ford Transit LWB (long wheelbase) medium roof (which equates to a cargo area about 12 feet deep and just under 6 feet tall.)

The first step in any conversion is returning the van to a pristine, near-factory state; a blank canvas, if you will.
(No, I'm not going to be tearing it down like iFixit.)

# Removing the Cargo Panels

For my van, that means removing the factory interior protective panels.
These are corrugated plastic panels that cover most of the cargo area.
There are four panels on the left side, two panels on the right side, one panel on the sliding door, and one panel each on the two rear doors.

I'm not planning on removing the lower plastic panel on the rear doors.
That panel is a different type than the cargo protection area; it's a nicer plastic, and it's designed to be permanently installed.
It contains the speakers and door opening/locking mechanism, and I don't want to mess with any of that quite yet.

The panels are secured with little two-part plastic snap-fit pins.
To remove the pins, you need to first pull out the center with the help of a wedge (I used a screwdriver).
This frees up space for the outer part to contract when pulling it out of the hole in the body.
To remove the outer frame, I found pulling on the thicker area (not where the center-pin-removal-slot is) is worked pretty well.
(I just jammed the screwdriver between the panel and the rim of the outer pin and wrenched at it until it popped out.
I'm lazy like that.)

There are around a dozen of these pins on each panel.
Some commenters online said that with some pins, there's a part that can fall into the body and be lost forever; I didn't find any of these in my panels.

# Cleaning Up the Wiring Loom

There is a wiring loom running along the left top corner of the cargo area, from behind the driver's head all the way to an arch over rear doors.
It's protected by two rather sad-looking, droopy pieces of plastic.
They showed signs of having fallen off in the past, and it looks like the previous owner said "screw it" and screwed the protective cover straight to the frame instead of trusting the factory-installed wiring loom clips.

I found that a lot of the wiring loom clips were either broken or missing, leading to the wire loom sagging an alarming amount in some spots.
The factory clips snap into the frame through two rectangular holes, one above the other.
I decided to make a 3D-printable clip that could snap into the same holes to secure the loom.

(For the curious: the top hole is 17mm wide, the bottom hole is 9mm wide, and both holes are 9mm tall. There's an inside radius of around 1.5mm, and the metal between the holes is 17mm edge-to-edge.)

An internal slot is designed to hold a 4mm-wide ziptie.
