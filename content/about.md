# About Me

Hi! I'm Forest Katsch, and I make cool stuff:

* I explain complex topics (like spaceflight) with friendly [infographics](/infographics)
* I [photograph](/photos) many things, including the [earth](/photos/landscapes), [the sky](/photos/sky), and [rockets](/photos/rockets)
* I write [fiction](/stories)
