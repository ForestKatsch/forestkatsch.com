These photos of Starship SN9's flight were taken from Isla Blanca Park, on South Padre Island, TX.

Unlike SN8's flight, I only made a single trip to South Padre Island, and I didn't stay for sunset (so I missed out on what turned out to be a gorgeous sunset.)

I shot SN8 photos from near the auditorium, but for SN9 I decided to shoot from the jetty.
