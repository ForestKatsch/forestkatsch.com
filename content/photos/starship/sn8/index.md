These photos of Starship SN8's flight were taken from Isla Blanca Park, on South Padre Island, TX.

I've already posted most of these online, but I've taken the time to go back and inspect this selection carefully from home, and re-edit the photos as needed.
A new perspective is always helpful, especially without the "I-just-watched-a-rocket-launch-and-land-and-explode" jitters.
