<!--I've written some [quick tutorials]()-->

I shoot primarily with my [Sony Î±6400](/photography/a6400), an APS-C mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera.
Like most photographers, I take far more photos than I could ever edit or post.


This lets me focus my editing efforts on only the best photos, 

<!--Like most photographers, I over-shoot and under-edit; this way, I have the ability to publish only my best photos.-->
